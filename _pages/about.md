We research new ways of using deep learning to solve problems at
NVIDIA. 

Our work presently focuses on four main application areas, as well as systems research:
  * Graphics and Vision. AI is transforming computer graphics, giving
  us new ways of creating, editing, and rendering virtual
  environments. Today's GPUs are fast enough to run neural networks on
  high-resolution inputs, giving us new possibilities to make
  real-time graphics more beautiful and more interactive. Vision and
  graphics go hand in hand - better analysis leads to better
  generation, and better generation can improve analysis.
  * Speech & Audio. We're especially interested in generative models
  for speech and audio synthesis.
  * Natural Language Processing. Like many other groups, we're excited
  about large-scale language modeling and transfer learning to various
  NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis and emotion classification.
  * Chip Design. As Moore's law slows, the process of designing and
  verifying chips becomes more expensive and also more important. We
  think AI has a role to play in improving the productivity of the
  chip design process and the quality of the resulting designs.
  * Systems for Deep Learning. Training and deploying large models
  requires significant computational capacity. Making the training
  process faster allows us to train on larger datasets, thereby
  increasing accuracy. Making deployment procedures more efficient
  allows us to deploy larger, more accurate models.
